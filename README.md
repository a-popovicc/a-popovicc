<h2>📌 IT Student @ FON | Java Developer in Progress</h2>

Hi! I’m Aleksa, an IT student at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences (FON, University in Belgrade, Serbia) and a Java developer continuously improving my skills through practical, real-world projects.

My focus is on building clean, structured, and scalable Java applications — starting from fundamentals and expanding into more advanced concepts like JavaFX, MVC architecture, Maven, and Spring.

<h3>📖 About Me</h3>

<p>I’m passionate about backend development and the Java ecosystem,
  with a strong understanding of OOP, data flow, and layered application design.
  I actively work on improving my Java skills beyond university coursework,
  constantly learning independently and building projects that reflect my growth from beginner to future professional.
  Over time, I’ve progressed from Swing to JavaFX and now to modern Java tools,
  while currently exploring Maven, Spring,
  and cleaner architectural patterns as part of my long-term development path..</p>
<h3>🧰Tech Stack</h3>
<h4>🔹 Languages & Core Skills</h4>
<ul>
<li>Java (OOP, Streams, Lambdas, Generics)

<li>JSON processing (Gson)</li>

<li>Exception handling</li>

<li>File operations</li>

<li>JUnit (unit testing)</li>

<h3>🌟 Featured Projects</h3>

<h4>🔹 Calculator – Java Swing Project</h4>

<p>A smart desktop calculator built as my first serious Java project after learning core programming fundamentals,
created using pure Swing inside Eclipse.
Features parentheses support and automatic bracket management.
Demonstrates handling of complex GUI events and also
represents my transition from basic Java syntax → building real GUI applications.</p>

<h4>🔹 eBank – JavaFX MVC Banking Simulator</h4>

<p>My second major application, focused on proper architecture and modularity. It has a clean 3-layer structure: GUI → App Layer → Data Layer,
and was built in IntelliJ IDEA using JavaFX and Scene Builder. JSON is used as a “mini database,”
and the project demonstrates improved organization, readability, and maintainability,
as well as my shift from raw GUI logic to a structured architecture.</p>
